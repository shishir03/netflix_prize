# netflix_prize
Last spring in AP Computer Science, we held a competition in class (based on the original Netflix Prize competition in 2009) in order to come up with an algorithm to guess the rating that a user would give a movie. The efficacy of the algorithms was measured via RMSE (root mean square error) of various test files of user ratings. We used Movie Lens to obtain the data for guessing the ratings. The code shown here won third place, and results for the test files can be found in data/results/netflix_tester_data.txt. The main prediction method can be found in src/NetflixPredictor.java in the guessRating() method. Outside of the main competition, we also recommended movies that the user might like. The GUI for this task can be displayed by running Main.java.
